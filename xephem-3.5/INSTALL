How to install XEphem Version 3.5, either for just yourself or system-wide:

1) Build the executable:

    1.1. Explode xephem-3.5.tar.gz:

	$ tar xfz xephem-3.5.tar.gz

    1.2. Build the libastro.a and libip.a libraries first:

	$ cd xephem-3.5/libastro
	$ make
	$ cd ../libip
	$ make

    1.3. Move up and over to the XEphem source directory and build:

	$ cd ../GUI/xephem
	$ xmkmf
	$ make

    If you get errors about Xm, you must find your Motif include files and
    library. Ask your sys admin to help, or try openmotif (www.motifzone.net).
    It might be just that your imake is not set up correctly in which case
    read through and edit Makefile.smple, save the changed version in Makefile
    then run make again.

2) For the very curious, run it now; then choose File->Quit and go to the next
   step:

	$ ./xephem

	If you get a message "X Resources out of date" you have installed
	XEphem before and must locate and remove the old resource file. It
	is not used with 3.5.

Next do either 3a or 3b, not both:

3a) Installing XEphem for just yourself without root permission (see
    next step for system-wide multiuser installation):

    3a.1 Copy the executable where you keep your private programs:

	$ cp xephem $HOME/bin			# or where ever

    3a.2 Create a directory off your HOME called .xephem for all per-user files

	$ mkdir $HOME/.xephem

    3a.3 Create an initial resource file called $HOME/.xephem/XEphem with
    just one line in it as follows:

	XEphem.ShareDir: <dir>
    
    where <dir> is the full path of the directory containing the directories
    auxil/, fifos/, and fits/ and catalogs/. These are in the source
    directory of the original tar kit; where you are now, if you have been
    following along. You can leave them here if you like or move them, just
    set <dir> to where ever they end up.

3b) Installing XEphem for multiple users (requires root permission) (skip if
    installing just for yourself):

    3b.1 Copy the executable where everyone can find it:

	$ cp xephem /usr/bin			# or where ever

    3b.2 Create a directory for system-wide read-only files to be shared by all
    XEphem users and fill with the defaults included in this kit:

	$ mkdir /usr/local/xephem		# or where ever
	$ cp -R auxil /usr/local/xephem		# copy auxil dir and contents
	$ cp -R catalogs /usr/local/xephem	# copy catalogs dir and contents
	$ cp -R fifos /usr/local/xephem		# copy fifos dir and contents
	$ cp -R fits /usr/local/xephem		# copy fits dir and contents
    
    3b.3 Do the same as step 3a.3 above but create the new file in a place
    where all X programs will look for their resources, such as

	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XEphem	# typical for linux and freebsd
    
    or 

	/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XEphem	# typical for traditional UNIX

4) That should do it. There is lots of help built-in. Enjoy! 

	$ xephem &

Let me know what you think.
